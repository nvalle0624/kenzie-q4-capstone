BananaDog - Alpha

Description:

This is the first iteration of BananaDog, an application for a dog training business where trainers and clients can book
sessions, communicate, and access a persistent log of dogsâ€™ info and daily reports. The app will also contain
functionality beyond scheduling and communicating, allowing trainers to automatically log times and notes for
trainings/activities per dog, per session.
